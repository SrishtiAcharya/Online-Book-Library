# LavenderReads - The Boundless Online Library

LavenderReads is an innovative and enchanting open book library system that transcends traditional boundaries by harnessing the power of APIs. 
Inspired by the effect of the color *lavender* has on human psychology, LavenderReads aims to create a magical repository of knowledge where readers can embark on an adventure of exploration & discovery.

This is for an imaginary online library platform where the user can enjoy the smooth interface o the website and check for the availability of the book in the store along with the basic details instead of following the racks for the alphabetical order of the books list like in traditional ways.

# Key Steps:

1. Conceptualization and Design
2. API Integration Connectivity
3. Quick Search Feature
